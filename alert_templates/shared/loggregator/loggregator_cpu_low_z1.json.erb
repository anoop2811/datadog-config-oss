Log onto the affected VM and check the `doppler` logs to look for signs of inactivity.\n1. Send the `doppler` process the `USR1` signal to dump its goroutine list to STDERR.\n1. Look in the goroutine dump for signs of deadlock.\n1. Capture the logfiles (with e.g. `bosh logs` on the jumpbox) for later study.\n1. Restart the affected process (with `monit`) or VM (with `bosh restart loggregator_z1 $INSTANCE_NUMBER`).\n\n<%= monitoringAndMetrics_pagerduty %>",
